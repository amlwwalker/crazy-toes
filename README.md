# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

- Project just to test building an app entirely powered by a smart contract
- Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe where players can create a new match, join a match and play

## Instructions

- One account creates a new game (it gets an ID) - TODO: display game ID
- Another player can search for open games and join them - TODO: Currently have to know a game ID to join
- Players take it in turns to move

## TODO

- need to be able to rejoin a game on page refresh, and see all previous moves (board positions already occupied)
- need to display the next board to play in, based on the last position played (even after refresh)
- need to see games that are in play and open, to rejoin them (currently need to know game ID)
- need to specify wallet address and piece (i.e X or O) at the moment don't know if you are X or O
